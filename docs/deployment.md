# Deployment

<!-- Not sure if we will use this table, once we update our cloud deployment config we can decide whether to keep it or not -->
<!-- ## AWS, GCP, Azure

For these cloud providers, first global variables must be set in the config file. After that a zip command must be run, as follows:

| Cloud Provider | Global (Environment) Variables                   | Zip Command          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| AWS (Lambda)   | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<>                             | `npm run zip-lambda` |
|                | AWS_REGION=<>                                    |                      |
|                | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<>                         |                      |
|                | AWS_FUNCTION_NAME=<>                             |                      |
| GCP            | GCP_PROJECT_ID=<>                                | `npm run zip-gcp`    |
|                | GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=<>                       |                      |
| Azure          | AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_NAME=<>                        | `npm run zip-azure`  |
|                | AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH=<> (Optional)     |                      |
|                | AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE=<> (Optional)  |                      | -->


## Environment variable

Commercetools Mollie integration requires 1 environment variable to start. This environment variable name is `CT_MOLLIE_CONFIG` and it must have keys as in a JSON structure below.

```json
{
    "port": 3000,
    "mollieApiKey": "mollieApiKey"
}
```

## AWS Lambda

1. Run `npm run zip-lambda-function` from the repository root directory (where package.json is located), to zip the contents in preparation for uploading to AWS
2. An AWS lambda function should be created ([Guide to creating lambda functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started-create-function.html)). The runtime should be Node.js 14.x.
3. Upload the 'extension-module.zip' file to the lambda function (in the code section, select upload from zip file)
4. Add the environment variable `CT_MOLLIE_CONFIG` into environment variables ([Guide to adding environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-config))

<!-- Environment variables deployment might change -->

## GCP functions

Setting up the extension as a google cloud function requires an existing function, setting up entry point and secrets and uploading the source code.

1. Run `npm run zip-gcp-function` from the repository root directory (where package.json is located)
2. Upload the generated zip file to your google cloud function ([Guide to creating cloud functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs#training-and-tutorials))
3. Add the `CT_MOLLIE_CONFIG` to the function as `Runtime environment variables`
4. Set Runtime to `Node.js 14` and change entry point to `handler`

## Azure

<!-- Still to implement -->

Add the following global variables into the config file:

    AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_NAME=<>
    AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PACKAGE_PATH=<> _Optional_
    AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE=<> _Optional_

## Docker

To run using a docker container, navigate to the root directory of the repository (where the Dockerfile is located) and build the container with:
`docker build -t ct-mollie-extension:latest .`

After the docker image has build, you could run it with a command like the following to start the container:
`docker run -e CT_MOLLIE_CONFIG=xxxxxx --name ct-mollie-extension ct-mollie-extension:latest`

When finished, to stop the container, run:
`docker stop ct-mollie-extension`
